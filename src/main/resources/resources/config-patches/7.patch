comment=# These settings are for the reactive adjustment mode.\n#  * MSPT stands for "milliseconds per tick", and tells you how long your server takes to tick on average. A server\n#    whose MSPT is above 50 will notice things slowing down, as the TPS drops.

comment=# How should we determine whether the simulation distance needs adjusting? Accepts three values:\n#  * proactive : Adjust the simulation distance so that the player-loaded chunk count is always below a set threshold.\n#  * reactive  : Adjust the simulation distance in response to changes in the server's MSPT.\n#  * mixed     : Be both proactive and reactive; prioritising decreasing the simulation distance over increasing.
