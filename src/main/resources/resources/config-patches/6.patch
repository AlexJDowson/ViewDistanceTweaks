comment=# How should we determine whether the simulation distance needs adjusting? Accepts three values:\n#  * proactive : Adjust the simulation distance so that the player-loaded chunk count is always below a set threshold.\n#  * reactive  : Adjust the simulation distance in response to changes in the server's TPS.\n#  * mixed     : Be both proactive and reactive; prioritising decreasing the simulation distance over increasing.

comment=# Set this to the maximum ticking chunk count your server can handle. The simulation distance of each world will be\n# adjusted such that the total number of player-loaded chunks is sitting as close to this value as possible.\n#  * If you know your server can handle up to p many players with a simulation distance of d, a reasonable choice is\n#    to set this to (2d + 1)^2 * p.\n#  * As an example, 5780 is the number of player-loaded ticking chunks for 20 players with a simulation distance of 8.

comment= # Set this to the maximum number of non-ticking chunks you want to be loaded by the view distance.\n#  * Note: this only counts chunks that are outside of the simulation distance of a player, but within the view\n#    view distance of a player.\n#  * If you know your server can handle up to p many players with a view distance of v and a simulation distance of s,\n#    a reasonable choice is to set this to ((2v + 1)^2 - (2s + 1)^2) * p.\n#  * As an example, 6720 is the number of non-ticking chunks loaded by the view distance for 20 players with a view\n#    distance of 12 and a simulation distance of 8.

comment= # Should we use TPS prediction when we are considering increasing the simulation distance?\n#  * For example, we may be at 20 TPS with a simulation distance of 6, meaning we would consider increasing the\n#    simulation distance to 7. However, if we saw that 10 minutes ago with a simulation distance of 7 we had 17 TPS,\n#    we would hold off on increasing.\n#  * Disabling this can lead to a back-and-forth game of increasing and decreasing the simulation distance every few\n#    minutes - not ideal.

key=passed-checks-for-increase
comment=# How many checks in a row that say to increase the simulation or view distance should be required before an increase\n# actually occurs?\n#  * This is useful as it guards against the following kind of case: A player leaves and the view distance is\n#    increased, but the player returns three minutes later and the view distance is lowered to its previous value.\n#  * Since increasing the view distance can cause lag-spikes for players with poorer connections, it is\n#    recommended to keep this value relatively high.

key=paper-settings.alternative-reactive-mode-settings
comment=# These settings are an alternative option to the reactive-mode-settings, allowing simulation distance to be adjusted\n# based on MSPT rather than TPS.\n#  * MSPT stands for "milliseconds per tick", and tells you how long your server takes to tick on average. A server\n#    whose MSPT is above 50 will notice things slowing down, as the TPS drops.
